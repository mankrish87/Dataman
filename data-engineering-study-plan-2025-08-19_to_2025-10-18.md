---

## 2. Time Budget and Study Principles
- 8 hours daily, 7 days a week (adjust one rest half-day if needed).
- Do Python DSA and SQL first every day. Maintain a “mistakes log” and weekly review.
- Emphasize fundamentals (Linux, Git, Python packaging/testing, SQL execution plans) for the first 2–3 weeks.
- Production mindset: tests, observability, docs, runbooks, idempotency, retries/backoff, cost notes, security notes.

---

## 3. Environment Setup (Day 1)
Complete on 2025-08-19:
- OS/Dev:
  - Linux (native or WSL2), Docker + Docker Compose, Python 3.11+, pyenv/poetry, Git, pre-commit.
  - Quality: ruff/flake8, black, isort, mypy, pytest, tox.
- Data infra (local via Docker unless noted): Postgres, Airflow, Kafka + Schema Registry, Spark (local), Hadoop/Hive (local or EMR later), dbt Core.
- Cloud (AWS account): IAM least-privilege user; S3, Athena, Glue, CloudWatch; budgets/alerts; AWS CLI.
- Databricks: Community Edition (or AWS Databricks workspace if available).
- CI: Jenkins (Docker) or GitHub Actions.
- Optional Observability: Prometheus + Grafana, OpenLineage/Marquez.
- Repo:
  - Create mono-repo: de-portfolio-2025/
    - week-01 … week-09 each with: src/, dags/, dbt/, data/, infra/, notebooks/, tests/, README.md, diagrams/
  - Default branches, PR templates, CODEOWNERS (self), lint/test CI.

---

## 4. Daily 8-Hour Template
- 1h30 — Python DSA (2–4 problems; 15 min review/mistakes log)
- 1h00 — Advanced SQL (1–2 queries with EXPLAIN/ANALYZE; 10 min notes)
- 2h15 — Weekly Core Topic/Labs (hands-on)
- 0h45 — Fundamentals/Basics (Linux/Git/Python/Networking/Data modeling) or catch-up
- 0h45 — System Design/Architecture patterns (3–4 days/week) or documentation on project days
- 1h00 — Certifications study or timed practice questions
- 0h45 — Project work (Mon–Fri); on Sat/Sun this becomes 4–6 hours to finish
- 10–15 min between blocks; if you overrun, borrow from Fundamentals/Catch-up

Tip: If fatigue hits, split into two 4-hour sessions (AM/PM).

- Projects: All quality criteria met; each includes one notable performance or cost insight.
- Design: 2 whiteboard designs/week with clear SLAs/SLOs, tradeoffs, and failure modes.
- Certifications: Weekly practice targets hit; two full-length practices before each exam.

---

## 14. GenAI in Data Engineering
- Pipelines for LLMs: text normalization, PII redaction, chunking, embedding generation, vector stores, reindexing strategies.
- Observability: embedding/data drift; cardinality explosions; latency budgets for semantic search.

Week 9 deliverable embeds at least one GenAI enrichment (e.g., semantic categorization) with metrics and cost controls.

---

## 15. Risks and Contingencies
- Overrun: Use the daily 45-min catch-up block; defer optional labs; prioritize weekly project completion.
- Tool friction: Swap local Hadoop/Hive with EMR or Databricks where easier.
- Certification crunch: If needed, prioritize DBX-DEA + AWS DEA; defer SAA by 2–4 weeks.
- Fatigue: Take one half-day rest/week; reduce DSA volume for one day rather than skipping entirely.

If you want, I can also generate a ready-to-use repo scaffold (folders, Docker Compose for Airflow/Kafka/Postgres, Makefile, CI templates, README template). Reply “generate the scaffold” and I’ll output all files so you can clone and start on Aug 19.
